                <h2>Welcome to <em>Medical Information and Advocacy</em></h2>
                <p>I'm glad you're here. This site is dedicated to sharing what I’ve learned over more than five years of working in healthcare.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>My name is Richenda, and I’ve spent the last several years working with both patients and providers to navigate the complicated world that is the United States healthcare system. Through it all, I've come to realize that what's lacking is basic health insurance literacy. This isn't just a patient issue. Oftentimes providers are just as confused about how this complex system works.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>
                <p>This site is a personal project, a place where I write openly about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Understanding the language of healthcare:</strong> What's a deductible? What's the different between a copay and coinsurance? How much am I responsible for paying?</li>
                    <li><strong>What "covered benefit" actually means:</strong> Sure, a patient plan says it covers a specific benefit, but what are the guidelines or coverage criteria for when that service will actually be reimbursed?</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare documentation:</strong> And why this is the most important and often overlooked part of the healthcare process</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialty advice on O&P:</strong> Working with providers with over 50 years of experience in this field, it's the specialty I know the most about.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Who this is for</h3>
                <p>There's a surprising amount of overlap in the information gap with both patients and providers. I hope to provide helpful information so that both parties can begin to speak a shared language and advocate for themselves and each other when interfacing with their health insurance company.</p>
